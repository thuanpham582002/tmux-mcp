## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- tmux installed and running

## Usage

### Configure Claude Desktop

Add this MCP server to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "tmux": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "tmux-mcp"]
  }
}
```

### MCP server options

You can optionally specify the command line shell you are using, if unspecified it defaults to `bash`

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "tmux": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "tmux-mcp", "--shell-type=fish"]
  }
}
```

The MCP server needs to know the shell only when executing commands, to properly read its exit status.
